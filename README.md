# TinDog

The [index.html](https://github.com/devCharaf/TinDog/blob/main/index.html) contains the code for a website named TinDog, a tinder version for dogs.

I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for sytling as well as some personal css styling.

you can view the final version at [TinDog](https://devcharaf.github.io/TinDog/).

The website is reponsive and changes its shape depending on your ycreen/window size.
